# MNIST-Classification

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning approaches to classify the MNIST dataset. Each approach is inspired by different machine learning algorithms and techniques, ranging from basic classifiers to advanced neural networks. These implementations are developed as part of coursework assignments, aiming to understand and improve upon the performance of each approach in classifying handwritten digits.
